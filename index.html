<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>I am Aniketh - an MSIS graduate from Santa clara university, california.
    
    I am an avid learner and my whole journey of migrating/transitioning from a bachelors in mechanical engineering to a masters in Information systems was truly riveting.
    
    I aspire to be a good application developer and aid in seamless transformation of  a wide range of business processes into more efficient ones.
